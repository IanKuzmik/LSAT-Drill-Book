# LSAT-Drill-Book
A LSAT Study Guide app I'm working on 

Planning on making this ReadMe more robust in the near future; I'll stick to bullet points for now, if'n anybody is even reading this

- I've been learning ios since August 2019
- This is my first official app
- Uses a private Vocab List library I'm also in the process of writing
  - Lots of mental work going into that, so I'm not sure if I'll make it public
  - I'll throw in a 'sample library' at some point so this code can work as expected
- While I'm keeping my work on the Vocab Libray (with Reading Comprehension and Analytical Reasoning Libraries coming as well), private, this app that uses them I want to keep public. 
- Feel free to do whatever with it

-Thanks for reading this. Who are you? How did you get here?
  -I'm new to Github, so, just curious. Hit me up
